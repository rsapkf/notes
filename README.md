## rsapkf's notes

These are companion notes to my [dotfiles](https://github.com/rsapkf/dotfiles) and [links](https://github.com/rsapkf/42/) where I keep short snippets of code, shell scripts, tricks and tips to remember stuff.

Notes are in [docs/](https://github.com/rsapkf/notes/tree/master/docs) directory.

### @TODO
- Implement `Copy to clipboard` option on code blocks(for some reason, [instructions](https://gist.github.com/yangshun/55db997ed0f8f4e6527571fc3bee4675) in the official documentation don't work for me).
- Migrate to [Docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).
